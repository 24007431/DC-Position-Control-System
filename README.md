# DC-Position-Control-System
## Aim:
To control the position of motor having the following specifications using MATLAB.
(J)     moment of inertia of the rotor =    3.2284E-6 kg.m^2
(b)     motor viscous friction constant =    3.5077E-6 N.m.s
(Kb)    electromotive force constant   =    0.0274 V/rad/sec
(Kt)    motor torque constant   =           0.0274 N.m/Amp
(R)     electric resistance  =              4 Ohm
(L)     electric inductance  =              2.75E-6H
## Apparatus Required:
Computer with MATLAB software
## Theory: 
A common actuator in control systems is the DC motor. It directly provides rotary motion and, coupled with wheels or drums and cables, can provide translational motion. The electric equivalent circuit of the armature and the free-body diagram of the rotor are shown in the following figure.
